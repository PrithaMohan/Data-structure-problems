Arun reads lot of story books and he keeps all the story books piled as a single stack. He wants to write a program to keep the order of
the books in the pile. The program must implement the following functionalities. 
- Add a book to the top of the pile when 1 is followed by the name of the book.
- Remove a book from the top of the pile when -1 is given as the input (provided the pile has atleast one book). 
- Print the name of the book on the top of the pile when 2 is given as the input (provided the pile has atleast one book).
- The program must exit when 0 is given as the input.
Boundary Condition(s): 
The maximum number of story books in the pile will be 100. The name of the book will not exceed 100 characters.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input: 
1 The Arrival
1 The Borrowers 
1 The Cat in the Hat
2
-1
2
1 Curious George 
2
-1
2
-1
2
-1
2
-1
1 Freight Train 
2
0
Output:
The Cat in the Hat The Borrowers Curious George The Borrowers The Arrival Freight Train 
Explanation: 
After the first three lines of input, the books from top to bottom in the pile are 
-The Cat in the Hat -The Borrowers 
-The Arrival
Now 2 prints "The Cat in the Hat" which is at the top of the pile. 
Then -1 removes the book on the top.
So now the books in the pile from top to bottom are 
-The Borrowers 
-The Arrival 
Now 2 prints "The Borrowers".
Now the book "Curious George" is added to the top of the pile.
So now the books in the pile from top to bottom are 
-Curious George 
-The Borrowers 
-The Arrival
Now 2 prints "Curious George". 
-1 removes "Curious George".
So now the books in the pile from top to bottom are
-The Borrowers
-The Arrival
Now 2 prints "The Borrowers".
-1 removes "The Borrowers".
So now the books in the pile from top to bottom are 
-The Arrival 
Now 2 prints "The Arrival".
-1 removes "The Arrival".
So now there are no books in the pile.
Now 2 does not print anything as the pile is empty. 
Now -1 does not remove anything as the pile is empty.
Then 1 adds "Freight Train" to the top of the pile.
Now 2 prints "Freight Train". 
Now 0 ends the program.
